Something interesting about me is that I have a twin brother. Why I want to join Mecha Solutions as a software engineer is because of two reasons. First of all, Mecha Solutions is a pioneer in AI solutions. And why I am specifically interested is because I think I've worked with a lot of cool applications over the last four years at my degree at a super university. One of the best projects that I worked on was on an interview software where you could just put in the interview that you're signing up for, let's say your job description here as you may and then you'll get a mock interview that you're there. Now, over there I have to implement a lot of AI solutions and I think what was the best outcome of it was that I figured out that AI is more than just using model and running it. It's about figuring out where to not use AI and how I can optimize costs. So I think that's something that makes a solution offer.", "role": "user", "interview_ended": false, "timestamp": "2024-03-13T03:03:54.587702"}, {"message": "That's fascinating, especially your project on the interview software. Could you share more details about your role in developing that AI-driven interview software, particularly any challenges you faced and how you overcame them?", "role": "assistant", "interview_ended": false, "timestamp": "2024-03-13T03:04:01.651663"}, {"message": "Yup, so something that I, some challenge that I faced was Optimizing Costs. Initially I started with Jack GPT4 Turbo which was a pretty expensive model. I was also using OpenYax Liskers which was again really expensive considering you had an hours worth of interview. So what I ended up doing was hosting Whisper locally and then instead of using Whisper using WhisperX which significantly improved load times and significantly improved the cost we had it probably reduced it by a factor of 3. Then again, Chai GPT 4 Turbo was really expensive so we tried to use 3 Turbo which was really bad. So then we used Mistral with a lot of prompt tuning which led to it working really really well as much as almost as good as Tire GP4. So I think that improved our costing a lot. More than that I think it was figuring out where I do not have to use AI. For example, I was trying to cut the audio I was trying to reduce the size of the audio instead of using a VAD or a voice activated detector like I was before I just manually wrote a small algorithm that could figure out okay this is relatively a very quiet period so this is where the user is not talking and again because I don't want to cut important parts of the audio I set the threshold to be really low so that I know for a fact only when the user is not talking for sure is removed so I think these small optimizations like these We are one of the biggest challenges that we faced.", "role": "user", "interview_ended": false, "timestamp": "2024-03-13T03:05:59.634781"}, {"message": "Your approach to optimizing costs and performance is impressive. Could you elaborate on your experience with prompt tuning for Mistral, and any specific strategies or methodologies you used to achieve effective results with it?", "role": "assistant", "interview_ended": false, "timestamp": "2024-03-13T03:06:04.128012"}, {"message": "So again, one of the best ones that we use is again trial and error and something cool that we came up with was if you go to chat GPT, there are a lot of fine-tuned versions you can get where they're made for prompt tuning. So we first laid out everything that we need on paper because I think me and my co-partner, we both thought that paper is the best way to go ahead with it. Writing down paper is the best way. So we wrote everything on paper, we realized what all we need. We concentrated it all into a decent prompt for CharGPT, which gave us a better prompt for Nustril. Using this base prompt, we started to run our software, see what parts are clapped, if we can improve it. Then, of course, because I was in a university, my professors were of great help. So I think they also helped me a lot in figuring out and giving me resources. So I think that was my approach. First, trying it with me and my partner using the resources I have, if not, asking help from a professor, which you know, and one of my professors at Ashoka is, was a businessman. So again, he, more than just giving me CS advice, he also gave me a lot of business advice.", "role": "user", "interview_ended": false, "timestamp": "2024-03-13T03:07:31.101294"}, {"message": "Thank you, Ruchi, for sharing your experiences and insights.
